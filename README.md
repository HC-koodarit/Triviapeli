<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Triviapeli was created during the Software Project II (Ohjelmistoprojekti II) course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in the autumn of 2022. The project was created by a team of six students specialising in software development.

Triviapeli is a React Native mobile app where players answer trivia questions from different categories, with a time limit on each question. The questions are fetched from [The Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

The game can be played in either single-player or multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode also functions as a drinking game. Players can choose what kind of drink they have, and answering questions incorrectly will eventually make the game prompt players to drink. Meanwhile, answering questions correctly will award players with power-ups that can be used to give other players tasks or get hints about the correct answer.

<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
## How to Play

When you open the app, you first see the home screen. Here you can choose which game mode you would like to play, Quickplay or Partymode. Quickplay is the single-player version that takes you straight to the game without any additional setup, while Partymode is the drinking game multiplayer mode for at least two players.

![HomeScreen](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/homescreen.jpg)

### Quickplay

The game begins immediately when you press the Quickplay button! Read the question and press on the right answer within 15 seconds. After you choose an answer (or the timer runs out) the results screen is shown, where you can see if the answer was correct, and your current points. End the game at any time by pressing the "End game" button.

![Quickplay](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/quickplay.jpg) ![Correct](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/correct.jpg)

### Partymode

#### Setup and Adding Players

Before the game starts, you are taken to the options screen. You can add players to the game by pressing the "Add player" button. Every player must choose a name and what type of drink they're using (the game can, of course, be played with non-alcoholic drinks as well). At least two players are needed to start the game, but there's no limits otherwise. You can also choose which categories you want the questions to be from, and what difficulty you want to use. At least one category must be selected to start the game. If you don't choose a difficulty, the game will use questions from all three difficulties.

![Options](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/options.jpg) ![AddPlayer](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/addplayer.jpg)

#### Gameplay

When you start the game, the game will tell you which player goes first.

![Welcome](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/welcome.jpg)

That player takes the phone, reads the question, and presses on the right answer within 15 seconds. After the player chooses an answer (or the timer runs out) the results screen is shown, where players can see if the answer was correct, and everyone's current scores. If a player answers enough questions incorrectly, the game will prompt them to take a sip or finish their drink. The results screen also shows which player is up next.

The game can be ended at any time by pressing the "End game" button. Players will then see the final results!

![Results](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/results.jpg)

#### Power-ups

If a player answers questions correctly, they start building a streak. Once a player gets a streak of three correct answers, they earn a level 1 power-up. This power-up can be used on their next turn to assign a task for another player. If a player gets a streak of five correct answers, their power-up upgrades to level 2, which can be used to get a hint.

![Partymode](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/partymode.jpg) ![Powerup](https://github.com/HC-koodarit/Triviapeli/blob/main/readme-images/powerup.jpg)

Using a power-up resets the streak, so the player can only have one power-up at a time. Answering a question incorrectly also resets the streak and removes the power-up! The player can determine when they want to use their powerup, or if they want to take the risk of losing it...
